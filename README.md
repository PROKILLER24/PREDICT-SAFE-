PredictSafe: AI-Driven Disaster Prediction and Response System
Overview
PredictSafe is an AI-powered disaster prediction and response platform designed to forecast and mitigate the impact of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and cyclones. This project integrates machine learning models with real-time data to provide accurate predictions and alerts, helping communities and governments prepare for and respond to disasters effectively.

Developed as part of a hackathon, PredictSafe focuses on utilizing technology to save lives and protect property by providing early warnings and actionable insights through a web-based platform.

Features
Earthquake Prediction:

Predicts seismic activity using historical and real-time data.
Displays potential impact zones and provides recommendations for safety.
Flood Prediction:

Analyzes weather data, river levels, and environmental factors to predict potential flooding areas.
Offers early alerts to reduce damage and guide evacuation efforts.
Cyclone Tracking and Prediction:

Tracks and predicts cyclone paths using meteorological data and machine learning models.
Displays real-time cyclone path projections, helping users stay informed and safe.
Live Data Integration:

Integrates live data from meteorological departments and geospatial APIs for accurate and up-to-date predictions.
Provides continuous monitoring and real-time updates.
User-Friendly Dashboard:

Interactive web interface for visualizing disaster predictions and data.
Easy access to disaster alerts and safety recommendations.
Tech Stack

Usage
Earthquake, Flood, and Cyclone Predictions:
Users can select a disaster type (e.g., earthquake, flood) to view real-time predictions and data visualizations.
Predictions include impact zones, time estimates, and safety alerts.
Live Monitoring:
The platform continuously updates with live data from geospatial and meteorological sources, ensuring accurate and timely alerts.
Data
Earthquake Data: Historical seismic records and live data from geospatial sources.
Flood Data: Real-time environmental data, including river levels and rainfall metrics.
Cyclone Data: Weather data from global meteorological organizations.
The data is processed using machine learning models trained to predict disaster occurrence and intensity.
